# moodybot

Purpose:
  A Discord Bot that recommends music based on a user's mood.

Creating a Local Copy:
  When creating a local version of the bot, you will need to create your own version of the bot, link it to a Discord Server, make a file called .env, and store the bot token in that file using the following syntax:
      
      MOODY_TOKEN={insert your token here}
  
  Replace {insert your token here} with your bot's provided token.
